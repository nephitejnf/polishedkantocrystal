# FAQ

If you have a question about playing Polished Crystal, or think you've found a bug, please read this FAQ first.

> At the time, I was asking really obvious questions like: "So 'wireless' means you're getting rid of the wires, right?"

### Is there a Pokédex document I can refer to?

The game's data files do a fairly good job of listing things you'll want to know.

* [Base stats and TM learnsets](data/pokemon/base_stats/)
* [Level-up learnsets and evolution methods](data/pokemon/evos_attacks.asm)
* [Egg moves](data/pokemon/egg_moves.asm)
* [Move attributes](data/moves/moves.asm)
* [TM+HM+tutor list](data/moves/tmhm_moves.asm)
* [Wild Pokémon](data/wild/)
* [Hidden Grottoes](data/events/hidden_grottoes/grottoes.asm)


### What are the options at the start of a new game?

* **Natures:** Enables natures from Gen 3.
* **Abilities:** Enables abilities from Gen 3.
* **Phys/Spcl split:** Enables the Physical/Special split from Gen 4.
* **Exp. scaling:** Enables the experience formula from Gen 5, which scales experience by the ratio of the opponent's level to your level.
* **IVs vary colors:** Enables color variation inspired by Stadium. DVs will subtly vary Pokémon colors. This applies to normal and shiny Pokémon.
* **Perfect stats:** All Pokémon stats, for you and the opponent, are calculated as if they had maximum IVs. The actual IVs are still random, so color variation and Hidden Power type are not affected.
* **Traded Pokémon treat you as OT:** All differences in traded Pokémon go away: they always obey you, don't gain boosted experience, and can be nicknamed.
* **Nuzlocke mode:** Enables a Nuzlocke run; see [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) for detailed clauses.

If you need to change these options after starting a game, press Left+B at the title screen to reset them.


### How do I evolve my Pokémon?

* Item trade evolutions (like Seadra into Kingdra while holding a Dragon Scale) now evolve while holding the item.
* Yanma, Tangela, and Piloswine evolve while knowing AncientPower.
* Eevee evolves into Leafeon in Ilex Forest, site of the Moss Rock.
* Eevee evolves into Glaceon in the Ice Path, site of the Ice Rock.
* Eevee evolves into Sylveon with a Shiny Stone.
* Magneton evolves into Magnezone in Rock Tunnel, site of the Lodestone.
* Machoke, Graveler, Haunter, and Kadabra evolve by having sufficient EVs in Attack, Defense, Speed, and Special respectively (five Protein, Iron, Carbos, or Calcium is enough).

### Where do I get Silver/Gold Leaves?

Silver Leaves are like Shards in future generations: they can be given to Move Tutors to learn moves. Wild Oddish have a 50% chance of holding Silver Leaves, and there are some hidden on the ground in Ilex Forest.

Gold Leaves can be given to the Move Maniac in Cianwood City to relearn moves. Wild Bellsprout have a 50% chance of holding Gold Leaves, and there are some hidden on the ground in Yellow Forest.

* HM06 Whirlpool is given to you after a battle with Lyra on Route 42, which becomes accessible after beating Jasmine.
* TM46 Thief is given to you by Lance after completing Team Rocket's Base in Mahogany Town.


### What do blessings and photographs do?

Daily blessings in Ecruteak City and photographs in Cianwood City make your Pokémon happier, just like haircuts or grooming.


### What is the Judge Machine?

The Judge Machine in Goldenrod City's PokéCom Center shows your Pokémon's EVs (effort) and IVs (potential). To unlock it, breed at least one Egg and then talk to the engineer working on it.


### What are the "door-shaped grooves" in the Ruins of Alph and Route 47?

Those are opened up after you catch all 28 Unown and talk to the scientist who gave you the Unown Dex.


### I don't like non-canon Pokémon types!

I was hesitant to make original changes like this, because the goal is to be an improved Crystal version, not a new game. In the end I made two versions, one regular (with changes) and one "faithful" (with original typings).
